Capstone Project. This Rady School of Management Master of Science in Business Analytics team has taken on the client Rady Childrenâ€™s Hospital (RCH) in order to improve an anticipated demand model for their Emergency Department. This is a particularly important aspect of the hospital system to be able to estimate demand since bed and staff resources are limited and there are costs or losses to have too many or too little staff on the floor at any given time. In order to assist in the decision-making process for allocating the proper amount of staff months in advance, our team has performed data exploration and analysis on individual patients and staff scheduling to best address this issue.
